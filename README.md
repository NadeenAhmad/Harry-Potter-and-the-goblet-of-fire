# Harry Potter and the goblet of fire
* As a team of 2 we built a role-playing game (RPG) with a main theme of Harry Potter using Java
* Simulating the Tri-wizard tournament from the Harry Potter series. 
* The game was made of three different maps representing the three tasks of the Tri-wizard cup Tournament
* Including four champions competing with each other. 
* This project helps me to enhance and develop the understanding and comprehending of some of the OOP “object-oriented programming “concepts and create a GUI using MVC model.
* Here is a short demo of a part of the game:
